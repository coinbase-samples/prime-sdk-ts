Common use cases: 1) Gas Price Adjustments: When a transaction is stuck due to low gas price, a new transaction with the same nonce but higher gas price can be submitted to replace it. 2) Transaction Cancellation: A user might want to cancel a pending transaction by replacing it with a new transaction (often a 0-value transfer to themselves with higher gas price). Note: When using this field, the disable_dynamic_nonce option must be set to false because the nonce would be automatically managed by the system.
